## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Title
<ul>
  <li>AI-Powered Smart Irrigation & Water Management System</li>
</ul>

<!-- Problem Description -->
## Problem Description

<ul>
  <li>Water scarcity and inefficient irrigation practices are critical challenges for Indian farmers.</li>
  <li>Farmers often over-irrigate or under-irrigate due to lack of soil moisture data, weather forecasts, and scientific insights.</li>
  <li>This leads to:
    <ul>
      <li>Excessive water usage and groundwater depletion.</li>
      <li>Reduced crop yields.</li>
      <li>Higher electricity and pumping costs.</li>
      <li>Long-term soil damage (salinity, erosion).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Proposed Solution -->
## Proposed Solution

<ul>
  <li>A low-cost IoT + AI-based irrigation management system to help farmers optimize water use.</li>
  <li>Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Soil moisture sensors linked with a mobile app for real-time soil water status.</li>
      <li>Weather-based irrigation scheduling using IMD and satellite data.</li>
      <li>AI-driven predictive irrigation models to suggest optimal water levels.</li>
      <li>IoT-based automated pump control (on/off).</li>
      <li>Voice-based irrigation advisory in local languages.</li>
      <li>Data dashboard for governments/NGOs to monitor water usage patterns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Innovation: Combines IoT hardware with AI prediction and localized advisories in a single affordable system.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Technical Approach -->
## Technical Approach

<ul>
  <li>Technologies:
    <ul>
      <li>Hardware: Low-cost soil moisture sensors, IoT-enabled pump controllers.</li>
      <li>Frontend: Flutter / React Native mobile app.</li>
      <li>Backend: Node.js / Django REST APIs.</li>
      <li>AI Models: TensorFlow for predictive irrigation requirements.</li>
      <li>Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase for real-time sync.</li>
      <li>APIs: IMD weather APIs for rainfall & temperature data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implementation Steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Phase 1 — Install soil sensors and IoT pump controllers.</li>
      <li>Phase 2 — Collect soil, crop, and weather data.</li>
      <li>Phase 3 — Train AI models for predictive water scheduling.</li>
      <li>Phase 4 — Develop farmer mobile app with alerts and voice support.</li>
      <li>Phase 5 — Pilot in water-scarce districts; refine based on results.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
